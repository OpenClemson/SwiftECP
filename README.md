Need Shibboleth login on your iOS / MacOS app but don't want to use a webview? Don't want to deal with XML or read a spec? Use SwiftECP to do the work for you!

SwiftECP is a spec-conformant Shibboleth ECP client. Simply provide credentials and a Shibboleth-protected resource URL and SwiftECP will hand you a Shibboleth cookie to attach to further requests or inject into a webview.

## Usage

```swift
let username = "YOUR_USERNAME"
let password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
let protectedURL = URL(
    string: "https://app.university.edu"
)!
let logger = XCGLogger()
logger.setup(level: .debug)

ECPLogin(
    protectedURL: protectedURL,
    username: username,
    password: password,
    logger: logger
).start { event in
    switch event {

    case let .value(body):
        // If the request was successful, the protected resource will
        // be available in 'body'. Make sure to implement a mechanism to
        // detect authorization timeouts.
        print("Response body: \(body)")

        // The Shibboleth auth cookie is now stored in the sharedHTTPCookieStorage.
        // Attach this cookie to subsequent requests to protected resources.
        // You can access the cookie with the following code:
        if let cookies = HTTPCookieStorage.shared.cookies {
            let shibCookie = cookies.filter { (cookie: HTTPCookie) in
                cookie.name.range(of: "shibsession") != nil
            }[0]
            print(shibCookie)
        }

    case let .failed(error):
        // This is an AnyError that wraps the error thrown.
        // This can help diagnose problems with your SP, your IdP, or even this library :)

        switch error.cause {
        case let ecpError as ECPError:
            // Error with ECP
            // User-friendly error message
            print(ecpError.userMessage)

            // Technical/debug error message
            print(ecpError.description)
        case let alamofireRACError as AlamofireRACError:
            // Error with the networking layer
            print(alamofireRACError.description)
        default:
            print("Unknown error!")
            print(error)
        }

    default:
        break
    }
}
```
